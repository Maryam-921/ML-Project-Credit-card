📊 Credit Card Data Clustering Project
This project explores and analyzes a credit card dataset using fundamental data science and machine learning techniques. The goal was to uncover hidden patterns and segment customers based on their spending behavior.

🔍 Key Highlights:
    * Data Exploration: Conducted a comprehensive summary of the dataset, including statistical descriptions (mean, median, mode), duplicate checks, and value counts to understand the structure and quality of the data.
    * Visualization: Used various plots—histograms, pie charts, box plots, strip plots, and line charts—to uncover trends and distributions across different customer features.
    * Preprocessing: Detected and handled outliers to improve data quality and prepared the dataset for modeling with appropriate train-test splits.
    * Machine Learning:
        -- Applied K-Means Clustering to group customers with similar behaviors.
        -- Used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
        -- Visualized cluster results for intuitive understanding.
        -- Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and enhance visualization of the clusters.
